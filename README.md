# recursiveFunctionImaging

This is a recursive function imaging software that takes a function and using recursive calls of the function prints the reulting speed of divergence. The divergence
is checked across the complex plane, additionally, logarithmic and exponential functions are used to show more variety in divergence and convergence speeds. 
I use PPM and PBM formats so that each pixel can be manipulated. Additionally examples of the uses have been shown in the mandelbrot's set's directory, where
images generated by the software are shown. 

There are multiple different recursive functions used- 
  #Mandelbrots set 
  #Teterations
  #Exponentian 
  #Circular and Absolute value convergence
