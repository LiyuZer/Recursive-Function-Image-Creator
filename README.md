# recursiveFunctionImaging

This is a recursive function imaging software that takes a function and using recursive calls of the function prints the reulting speed of divergence. The divergence
is checked across the complex plane, additonally lograithmix and exponential fucntion are used to show more variety in divergenc and convergence speeds. 
I use PPM and PBM format, so that each pixel can be manipulated. Additonally examples of the uses have been shown in the mandelbrots set's directory, where
images generated by the sofware are shown. 

There are multiple different recursive functions used- 
  #Mandelbrots set 
  #Teterations
  #Exponentian 
  #Circular and Abolsute value convergence
